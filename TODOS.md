### TODOs

-  Clone on Mac, verify everything's working there too.

-   Determine if we need `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` scripts. If not, include in `.gitignore`.

-   Check Square's `Catalog` and `Inventory` APIs.

-   Read through the following tutorials:

    -   [Setting up Swagger 2 with a Spring REST API](https://www.baeldung.com/swagger-2-documentation-for-spring-rest-api).
    -   [jUnit 5 User Guide]( https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) (emphasize on where it differs from 4).
    -   [Building REST services with Spring](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/), and [a 
         more gentle GitHub tutorial](https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-rest).
